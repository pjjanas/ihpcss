This program has two graph generators: generate_nice_graph and generate_sneaky_graph. If you intend to submit, your code will be timed on the sneaky graph, remember to try both.
Generate a graph for testing purposes (i.e.: a nice and conveniently designed graph :) )
0.00 seconds to generate the graph.
